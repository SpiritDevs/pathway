# directory, because the path unit depends on a fact about this machine: which
# ABI directory actually carries KWin's development files (lib64 vs lib vs
# Debian multiarch — the same candidates the server's KWIN_CMAKE_CONFIG_PATHS
# probes). A checked-in unit could only hardcode one machine's answer.
#
# Where this checkout lives is deliberately NOT baked into the service. It runs
# a stable wrapper in ~/.local/bin that reads the source directory from a state
# file this script writes; moving or updating the app rewrites the state file
# and the units keep working, and a checkout that is gone fails loudly in the
# journal instead of silently never rebuilding.

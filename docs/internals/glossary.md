## Concepts

### Project and workspace

#### Project

The top-level workspace record in the app. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a project has a `workspaceRoot` and a title. It does not contain threads: `OrchestrationProject` and `OrchestrationThread` are separate arrays on the read model, and a project can have zero threads. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Workspace root

The root filesystem path for a project. In [the orchestration model][1], it is the base directory for branches and optional worktrees. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Worktree

A Git worktree used as an isolated workspace for a thread. If a thread has a `worktreePath` in [the contracts][1], it runs there instead of in the main working tree. Git operations live behind the VCS driver contract in `apps/server/src/vcs/VcsDriver.ts`, implemented by [GitVcsDriverCore.ts][3].

### Thread timeline

#### Thread

The main durable unit of conversation and workspace history. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a thread holds messages, activities, checkpoints, and session-related state. See [projector.ts][4].

#### Turn

A single user-to-assistant work cycle inside a thread. It starts with user input and ends when the session leaves `running` status, which [projector.ts][4] treats as the authoritative completion signal (`settledTurnStateForSessionStatus`). Checkpoint and diff work may settle afterward without changing when the turn ended. See [the contracts][1] and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Activity

A user-visible log item attached to a thread. In [the contracts][1], activities cover important non-message events like approvals, tool actions, and failures. They are projected into thread state in [projector.ts][4].

### Orchestration

Orchestration is the server-side domain layer that turns runtime activity into stable app state. The main entry point is [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7], with core logic in [decider.ts][8] and [projector.ts][4].

#### Aggregate

The domain object a command or event belongs to. In [the contracts][1], that is usually `project` or `thread`. See [decider.ts][8].

#### Command

A typed request to change domain state. In [the contracts][1], commands are validated in [commandInvariants.ts][9] and turned into events by [decider.ts][8].
Examples include `thread.create`, `thread.turn.start`, and `thread.checkpoint.revert`.

#### Domain Event

A persisted fact that something already happened. In [the contracts][1], events are the source of truth, and [projector.ts][4] shows how they are applied.
Examples include `thread.created`, `thread.message-sent`, and `thread.turn-diff-completed`.

#### Decider

The pure orchestration logic that turns commands plus current state into events. The core implementation is in [decider.ts][8], with preconditions in [commandInvariants.ts][9].

#### Projection

A read-optimized view derived from events. See [projector.ts][4], [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11], and [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10].

#### Projector

The logic that applies domain events to the read model or projection tables. See [projector.ts][4] and [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11].

#### Read model

The current materialized view of orchestration state. In [the contracts][1], it holds projects, threads, messages, activities, checkpoints, and session state. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10] and [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7].

#### Reactor

A side-effecting service that handles follow-up work after events or runtime signals. Examples include [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], [ProviderCommandReactor.ts][12], and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Receipt

A typed signal emitted when an async milestone completes, such as `checkpoint.baseline.captured`, `checkpoint.diff.finalized`, or `turn.processing.quiesced`. Receipts are a test-only mechanism: the production `RuntimeReceiptBusLive` publish is a no-op and only the test layer is PubSub-backed. Do not build production behavior on them. See [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13] and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Quiesced

"Quiesced" means a turn has gone quiet and stable: follow-up work such as [CheckpointReactor.ts][6] has settled. It appears in [the receipt schema][13], so in practice it is something tests wait on rather than a production signal.

### Provider runtime

The live backend agent implementation and its event stream. The main service is [ProviderService.ts][14], the adapter contract is [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and the overview is in [providers.md][16].

#### Provider

The backend agent runtime that actually performs work. Five drivers ship built in: Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode. See [ProviderService.ts][14], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CodexAdapter.ts][17] as a representative adapter.

#### Session

The live provider-backed runtime attached to a thread. Session shape is in [the orchestration contracts][1], and lifecycle is managed in [ProviderService.ts][14].

#### Runtime mode

The safety/access mode for a thread or session. [The contracts][1] define four values: `approval-required`, `auto-accept-edits`, `auto`, and `full-access`. See [permission modes][18].

#### Interaction mode

The agent interaction style for a thread. In [the contracts][1], the values are `default` and `plan`.

#### Assistant delivery mode

Controls how assistant text reaches the thread timeline. In [the contracts][1], `streaming` updates incrementally and `buffered` accumulates text. Buffered delivery is not held until the turn completes: it spills once accumulated text would exceed 24,000 characters, and flushes at approval and user-input boundaries. See [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Snapshot

A point-in-time view of state. The word is used in multiple layers, including orchestration, provider, and checkpointing. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

### Checkpointing

Checkpointing captures workspace state over time so the app can diff turns and restore earlier points. The main pieces are [CheckpointStore.ts][19], [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint

A saved snapshot of a thread workspace at a particular turn. In practice it is a hidden Git ref in [CheckpointStore.ts][19] plus a projected summary from [ProjectionCheckpoints.ts][21]. Capture and lifecycle work happen in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint ref

The durable identifier for a filesystem checkpoint, stored as a Git ref. It is typed in [the contracts][1], constructed in [Utils.ts][22], and used by [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Checkpoint baseline

The starting checkpoint for diffing a thread timeline. This flow is surfaced through [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13], coordinated in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], and supported by [Utils.ts][22].

#### Checkpoint diff

The patch difference between two checkpoints. Query logic lives in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], diff parsing lives in [Diffs.ts][23], and finalization is coordinated by [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Turn diff

The file patch and changed-file summary for one turn. It is usually computed in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], represented in [the contracts][1], and recorded into thread state by [projector.ts][4].

## Practical Shortcuts

- If you see `requested`, think "intent recorded".
- If you see `completed`, think "result applied".
- If you see `receipt`, think "async milestone signal, for tests".
- If you see `checkpoint`, think "workspace snapshot for diff/restore".
- If you see `quiesced`, think "all relevant follow-up work has gone idle".

### Identity and onboarding

Terms below describe this fork, where an account is required to open the app. Upstream Pathway
treats identity as an optional T3 Connect concern. See [decisions/](./decisions/).

#### Account

The Clerk user. The only identity in the system, and the first user-scoped thing in a codebase
that is otherwise environment-scoped or client-scoped. Distinct from an **environment**, which is
a machine and its state, and from a **client**, which is one installed app. One account spans many
of each.

#### Auth gate

The single decision about whether a visitor may reach the app, made by
`resolveClerkAuthGateState` in `apps/web/src/components/clerk/authGate.logic.ts`. It has five
outcomes — `authenticated`, `loading`, `onboarding` (signed in, profile incomplete), `public`,
`redirect`. Not to be confused with the **primary
environment auth gate** (`resolveInitialServerAuthGateState`), which decides whether this client
may talk to a T3 server. The two are independent: being signed in says nothing about being paired
to a server.

#### Profile

The user-scoped record of display name, avatar, account kind, and survey answers. Lives on the
Clerk user — native fields plus `unsafeMetadata` — not in `settings.json` and not in
localStorage, both of which are per-machine. See
[decisions/0003](./decisions/0003-profile-in-clerk-user.md).

#### Account kind

The discriminant of the profile: `individual` or `company`. Chosen in onboarding, and it selects
which branch of the step graph runs. A sum type, not a flag — the fields that follow differ
entirely by branch.

#### Onboarding

Ambiguous in this codebase; always qualify it.

**Profile onboarding** is the blocking, resumable stepper at `/onboarding` that collects the
profile after registration ([decisions/0004](./decisions/0004-onboarding-stepper.md)).

**Connect onboarding** is the pre-existing post-sign-in wizard in
`apps/web/src/components/cloud/ConnectOnboardingDialog.tsx` that publishes an environment and
connects devices. It runs inside the authenticated shell, so profile onboarding always precedes
it.

#### Company

An organization the account belongs to, modelled as a Clerk organization. Has identity and
membership independent of whoever created it. In v1 membership grants nothing — no shared
billing, visibility, or data — which is what makes email-domain matching an acceptable way to
offer it. See [decisions/0005](./decisions/0005-company-via-clerk-organizations.md).

#### Domain auto-join

Planned, not yet implemented (ships with the organizations change; see
[decisions/0005](./decisions/0005-company-via-clerk-organizations.md)). Offering a registering
user membership in an existing company when their verified email domain matches its verified
domain. Always **offered and opt-in**, never applied silently. Free and disposable mail domains
will be excluded, a check that only means anything server-side.

#### Pending session

A Clerk session that is authenticated but has an outstanding task, such as selecting an
organization. Eleven non-test call sites pass `treatPendingAsSignedOut: false` to keep such a
session from reading as signed out — including the auth gates themselves; enabling organizations
is what makes that state common rather than rare, and each site needs a deliberate answer before
that change lands.

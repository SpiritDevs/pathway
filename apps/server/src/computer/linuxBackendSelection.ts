 * Which computer backend this Linux host gets, decided once at startup.

 * human is sitting at.** Every backend this module can resolve gives the agent
 * a seat of its own — a compositor plugin's dedicated seat on the desktop the
 * human is looking at, or a private nested compositor everywhere else. There
 * is no shared-seat backend: anything that attached virtual devices to the
 * human's own `wl_seat` would move their real cursor, so no such backend
 * exists in the tree to be selected, forced, or fallen back to.
 *
 * Beyond that rule, an explicit ordered resolution with **no fallback in any
 * direction**. A tier that fails stays failed, and the backend it produces
 * explains why — an operator who named a backend is debugging that backend,
 * and quietly giving them a different one wastes the next hour of their life.
 *
 * The resolution order: the `PATHWAY_COMPUTER_BACKEND` override, then the
 * detection tiers each Linux backend registers here, best desktop first. A
 * host no tier claims gets no Linux selection, and `Layers/ComputerService.ts`
 * falls through to the Cua host when one is configured and to the unavailable
 * backend otherwise.

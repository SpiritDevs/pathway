 * working in. The compositor plugins refuse that from inside the compositor
 * (`com.spiritdevs.pathway.ComputerUse.Error.HumanActive`) and the server
 * refuses it from its own reading of the human's devices, and both carry the
 * same token so the caller that matters — the tool surface, and the panel copy
 * telling the user why the agent paused — treats them identically: wait, then
 * try again.

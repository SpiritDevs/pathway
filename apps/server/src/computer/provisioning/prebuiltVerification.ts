// @effect-diagnostics nodeBuiltinImport:off - SHA-256 over the bytes about to be installed; Effect has no hash module.
/**
 * The checksum every shipped native binary is verified with.
 *
 * What the checksum is for: catching a bundle that arrived damaged. The
 * prebuilt binaries ship inside the application package next to the manifest
 * that names them, so the failure modes are a truncated or corrupted file in a
 * half-written update, a packaging step that copied the wrong build under a
 * name, or an unpacker that mangled bytes. Every one of those turns into a
 * compositor plugin that KWin refuses or, worse, loads and crashes on, and the
 * checksum turns them into a clear error before the file reaches the plugin
 * directory.
 *
 * What it is not for: tampering. Anyone who can alter a binary in the bundle
 * can alter the manifest beside it in the same operation, so a matching hash
 * proves the two agree with each other and nothing more. Provenance of the
 * bundle as a whole is the installer's and the platform's job (package
 * signatures, update signing), not this file's.
 *
 * The bytes are verified once and then written as-is by the caller: hashing a
 * path and then copying that path again would verify one read and install
 * another. Backend-agnostic, so it lives on its own rather than inside one
 * backend's provisioning module.

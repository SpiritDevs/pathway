// @effect-diagnostics nodeBuiltinImport:off - cmake version files and library names are read synchronously behind injectable readers.
/**
 * The Qt and KDE Frameworks versions installed on this host, read off disk.
 *
 * A KWin plugin built on one distribution loads on another only when the
 * libraries it was linked against are the same versions there: the KWin
 * version is checked first and exactly, but two distributions can ship the
 * same KWin on different Qt or KF releases, and a plugin built against the
 * wrong ones fails at load with nothing more than `false` from KWin. So a
 * cross-distribution prebuilt is accepted only when both versions match the
 * ones recorded at build time, and this is the one place they are read.
 *
 * Reading them costs no process: the cmake package version files every
 * distribution installs with the development packages carry the version, and
 * when those are absent (a machine with the runtime but not the -devel
 * packages) the versioned soname of the library itself does.

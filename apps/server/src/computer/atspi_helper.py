"""Read bounded AT-SPI trees and answer JSON-RPC requests on stdio.

The helper speaks D-Bus to the accessibility bus directly through Gio rather
than through libatspi. libatspi turns an unreachable accessibility bus into a
``g_error`` (``dbind-ERROR``), which aborts the whole process with SIGABRT and a
core dump that Python cannot catch; it also issues every call synchronously,
one round trip at a time. Talking to the bus ourselves makes an unreachable bus
an ordinary error reply and lets every node of a tree level be asked at once.

Wire protocol version 2 (see ``PROTOCOL_VERSION``): tree nodes carry their
child index ``i`` instead of a full path, trees report ``truncated`` and a
per-window ``status``, and every reply names the protocol so a client and a
helper from different builds refuse each other instead of misreading trees.
